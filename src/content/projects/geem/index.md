# GEEM

## The Problem

Today's travelers face a fragmented digital experience. To plan a single trip, they often have to juggle multiple applications: one for finding accommodation (like Booking.com), another for navigation (like Google Maps), a third for finding food and attractions (like Yelp or Tripadvisor), and separate apps for local transport. This creates inconvenience and makes it difficult to have a seamless travel experience.

## Our Solution: GEEM

Our solution is *GEEM* (an acronym for Hadi Gidelim - "Let's Go"), an integrated mobile application designed to be the single source of truth for a traveler.

GEEM aims to consolidate all essential travel services into one user-friendly platform. Our goal is to analyze user behavior, search queries, and reviews to provide a deeply personalized and efficient travel-planning tool that improves with every use.

## Key Features

- **Unified Platform:** Integrates accommodation booking, restaurant/attraction discovery, and public transportation mapping all in one app.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Uses data analysis to understand user preferences and suggest relevant locations, activities, and food.
- **Transportation Integration:** Provides users with the best public transport routes to their chosen destinations, be it a hotel, restaurant, or landmark.
- **Community-Driven Content:** Builds a community where users can share reviews, ratings, and real-time information, ensuring all data is current and reliable.
- **Simplified Booking:** Offers a straightforward process for booking hotels and other accommodations directly within the app.

## Project Details

- **Business Model:** The app was designed with a "Freemium" model, with revenue opportunities from advertising, partnership programs with local businesses, data licensing, and API integrations.
- **The Team:** This project was a collaborative effort by:
    - Me
    - 3 other people
